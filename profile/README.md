# Team Biobox üêüüì¶

Hi! We are a team of biologists, engineers and software devs building the biobox: a modular, robust and cost-effective solution to freshwater biodiversity data collection. We have implemented our Biobox solution in the river Itchen (Winchester, United Kingdom) and would like to make our project publicly available.

We plan to publish all schematics, code and results publicly so as to raise awareness for freshwater biodiversity in the research community and to allow for users from all around
the world to have accessible datasets for our data. We are willing to fully fund implementations of our project in new contexts (e.g. different rivers or water bodies)!

## Format

```./arduino``` contains the arduino scripts that we use to collect data from the biobox as well as templates for other forms of data collection.  

```./organism-classification``` contains template python scripts (built in CLIP and CLIP segment) that allow for the detection and classification of recorded images from the biobox.  
```./interface``` contains the code that powers our data visualisation interface.  
```./buildinstructions``` will contain detalied instructions, CAD models and files to show our design process.
