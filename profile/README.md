# Team Biobox üêüüì¶

Hi! We are a team of biologists, engineers and software devs building the biobox: a modular, robust and cost-effective solution to freshwater biodiversity data collection.

We plan to publish all schematics, code and results publicly so as to raise awareness for freshwater biodiversity and make research more equitable..
